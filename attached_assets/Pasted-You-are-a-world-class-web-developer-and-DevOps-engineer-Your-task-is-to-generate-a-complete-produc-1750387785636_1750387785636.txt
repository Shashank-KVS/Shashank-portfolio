You are a world-class web developer and DevOps engineer. Your task is to generate a complete, production-ready React portfolio website codebase, fully styled with Tailwind CSS and animated with Framer Motion. The deliverable must include:

1. **Full Directory Structure**  
   - Root folder name: `shashank-portfolio`  
   - Subfolders: `public/`, `src/components/`, `src/pages/`, `src/assets/`, `src/styles/`, and any config folders (`.github/workflows/`, etc.).  
   - All file names and paths explicitly listed.

2. **Complete Code for Every File**  
   - `package.json`, `tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js`, `.gitignore`, `README.md`  
   - `public/index.html`  
   - `src/index.js`, `src/App.js`  
   - Component files for Hero, About, Skills, Projects, Blog, Contact, Footer  
   - CSS import and Tailwind setup in `src/styles/globals.css`  
   - Framer Motion animations in components  
   - Image placeholder `/src/assets/shashank.jpg` and instructions to replace

3. **Build & Deployment Instructions in README.md**  
   - Exactly how to install dependencies (`npm install` or `yarn`), run dev server (`npm run dev`), build (`npm run build`), and preview  
   - Steps to initialize a new Git repo from the zip:  
     1. `unzip shashank-portfolio.zip`  
     2. `cd shashank-portfolio`  
     3. `git init`  
     4. `git add .`  
     5. `git commit -m "Initial portfolio site"`  
     6. `gh repo create Shashank-KVS/portfolio --public --source=. --remote=origin`  
     7. `git push -u origin main`  
   - Hosting on GitHub Pages or Vercel: exact commands or UI steps.

4. **Zip File Packaging**  
   - After generating the code, package it into `shashank-portfolio.zip` and make it downloadable in the response.

5. **Step-by-Step “First Things to Do” Section**  
   - After downloading the zip, exactly what the user must do to get the site live (unzip → install → git init → push → deploy).

Output format:  
- A downloadable zip link (or code block with a link placeholder)  
- A bullet-point “First things to do” list  
- The full directory tree  
- All file contents inline
